excerpt: " This paper performs a nonparametric analysis of jump activity for the Chinese
 equities market. More precisely, we perform formal tests to decide whether the
 jumps in the 50 exchange‚Äêtraded fund (50ETF) and its volatility occur together
 by using the implied volatility index (iVIX) as a proxy for volatility. Our em
pirical findings are as follows: (i) joint jumps in the 50ETF and iVIX hardly
 occur, especially during noncrisis periods; (ii) there is a strong degree of de
pendence between the jump sizes of the 50ETF and iVIX when disaggregating
 jumps into their positive and negative parts; (iii) the jump component seems to
 contribute more to the leverage effect than the diffusive component."
